# Hello!

### This code is used to organize images in a directory. First, it lists all the files in the directory, and then for each file, it extracts the model name from the file name and selects it as the name of the new directory . Then it moves the file to the new directory.
### If you have a store that has a lot of photos or videos and you want to sort them, you can use this code and thank Python.
### I wrote this code for my company exactly for this purpose and saved the company from a crisis !
